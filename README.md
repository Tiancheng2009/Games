# Games
A collection of simple, completed and uncompleted games, that I have created in my free time.

Connect 5: a 2 player game where the first person to have 5 consecutive, uninterrupted, and linear pieces wins the game.

Weiqi: a 2 player game where the objective is to occupy and takeover as much space on the board as possible. A region is "surrounded" when all of the pieces inside are of the same color and no empty space can be reached by only moving up, down, left, or right from any of the pieces within the "surrounded" region.
